## Here are my projects in chronological order:

[interest-calc.html](interest-calc.html)

This was my first version of an interest calculator using basic html and css knowledge.

[bootstrap-interest-calc.html](bootstrap-interest-calc.html)

Using the Bootstrap framework, I was able to quickly and easily make a second version that looks cleaner and adjusts according to the application window size.
