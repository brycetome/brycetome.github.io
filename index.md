## Here are my projects in chronological order:

[interest-calc.html](interest-calc.html)

This was my first version just using basic html and css knowledge. Helped me apply the knowledge I was learning on [freecodecamp.org](freecodecamp.org).

[bootstrap-interest-calc.html](bootstrap-interest-calc.html)

Using the Bootstrap framework, I was able to quickly and easily make a second version that looks cleaner and adjusts according to the application window size.

[interest-calc-v3.html](interest-calc-v3.html)

This is a WIP where the calculator pops up and disappears when a button is clicked -- the button is on the bottom of the page.

[scholarlinq.com video](scholarlinq.com)

Not a programming project, but made this video in a day for my friend's startup -- which is a very quick turnaround to build a video. This is the friend who may want to use the calculator on this site.
