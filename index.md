## Here are my projects in chronological order:

[interest-calc.html](interest-calc.html)

This was my first version just using basic html and css knowledge. Helped me apply the knowledge I was learning on [freecodecamp.org](freecodecamp.org).

[bootstrap-interest-calc.html](bootstrap-interest-calc.html)

Using the Bootstrap framework, I was able to quickly and easily make a second version that looks cleaner and adjusts according to the application window size.

[interest-calc-v3.html](interest-calc-v3.html)

This is a WIP where the calculator pops up and disappears when a button is clicked.

[test on site](scholarlinq.html)

I put the calculator on my friends website as a test.
