## Here are my projects in chronological order:

[interest-calc.html](interest-calc.html)

This was my first version just using basic html and css knowledge. Helped me apply the knowledge I was learning on [freecodecamp.org](freecodecamp.org).

[bootstrap-interest-calc.html](bootstrap-interest-calc.html)

Using the Bootstrap framework, I was able to quickly and easily make a second version that looks cleaner and adjusts according to the application window size.

[interest-calc-v3.html](interest-calc-v3.html)

This is a WIP where the calculator pops up and disappears when a button is clicked -- the button is on the bottom of the page.

[scholarlinq.com video](https://scholarlinq.com/)

Not a programming project, but made this video in a day for my friend's startup -- which is a very quick turnaround to build a video because he requested and needed it that soon, but we worked on the script together. Just scroll to see it on the link. This is the friend who may want to use the calculator I made above on this site.

## Potential Ideas

I'm thinking about returning to my smart mirror and adding a feature with a running app API to display my past runs. I also may try to start a MySQL project to store information like and ask a smart speaker to speak it such as: What time is practice? How far do I run today?
